I'm thrilled to announce that i have recently completed my Ineuron intership project on Deloitte Case Study! 🎉🤝 A comprehensive dataset containing data from 1989 - 2018.

# Problem Statement ❇ -
In this data analysis project 📊 , we aim to analyze and structure time-series data related to key economic indicators, including Consumer Price Index (CPI), Exchange Rate, and Exports, for 200 countries 📭 sourced from "The World Bank" 🏦 . The data represents various financial service aspects, such as credit unions, banks, insurance companies, and investment funds, and covers the period from the past to the present.

# Objective - 
Data Structuring and Insights - The provided data is unstructured and requires preprocessing. The individual should be able to transform and structure the data appropriately, extracting valuable insights to understand trends, patterns, and relationships among CPI, Exchange Rate, and Exports.

# Year-over-Year (YoY) 💹 and Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) Analysis - 
Perform YoY and CAGR calculations on the dataset to analyze the growth and fluctuations of economic indicators over time. The individual should be able to present these analyses effectively on the dashboard.

# Deduplication and Error Handling ⁉ - 
Implement a robust deduplication process to remove redundancies and handle erroneous results that may exist in the dataset. The individual should demonstrate their ability to clean the data effectively.

# Build Interactive Dashboard 📊 - \
ensure that the graphical representation of data in the dashboard is dynamic in nature. When slicers are applied to select a specific country and time period, the data in all three charts should automatically adjust accordingly, providing real-time insights 💡.

# Tools Used:-
1. Excel - For data cleaning purpose.
2. Power BI - For data transformation , error handling, 
     data modeling and dashboard creation.
